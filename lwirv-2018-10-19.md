# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday October 19, 2018

## glibc Floating-Point Test Suite

As part of the RV32I glibc submission process, Zong from Andes has
submitted a [glibc patch
set](https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2018-10/msg00236.html) to fix
a generic floating-point bug that crosses the boundary between GCC and
glibc.  There's been a bit of feedback that, quite honestly, I don't
understand -- the combination of floating-point and glibc macros pretty
much guarantees that I won't be able to read the diff.

Luckily, it appear some smart glibc maintainers have figured out what's
going on and have helped Zong work through some issues.  I look forward
to the v2 patch set!

## binutils-2.31.1 Backports

Kito from Andes has [backported a handful of
fixes RISC-V specific
fixes](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb/pull/162) to
`binutils-2.31.1`.  The most important fix here is to avoid generating
incorrect executables with PC-relative relocations that have addends, as
was discussed in a previous post.  Like usual, anyone distributing
RISC-V toolchains should update.

## Floating-Point Support in `ptrace()`

Jim has [submitted a patch to add floating-point support to our `ptrace()`
implementation](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-riscv/2018-October/001828.html).
There are some interface issues in this version, but I'm sure they'll
get ironed out in time for the 4.20 merge window.

## MUSL Support in `riscv-gnu-toolchain`

Nick Kossifidis has [opened a PR to add support for MUSL to
`riscv-gnu-toolchain'](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/pull/386),
which should be useful for anyone working on our MUSL port.  We're not
upstream there yet, but reading the patches that Michael Clark sent
upstream is still on my TODO list!

## HiFive Unleashed Linux Drivers

Paul has posted a [driver for the `sifive,uart0` serial
controller](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-riscv/2018-October/001834.html)
as well as the [associated device tree
binding](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-riscv/2018-October/001833.html)
to the Linux mailing lists.  There are some issues, but hopefully
they'll get resolved soon.

Additionally, Atish has a [patch set containing drivers for our GPIO and PWM
controller](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-riscv/2018-October/001702.html)
that was posted to the list last week.
