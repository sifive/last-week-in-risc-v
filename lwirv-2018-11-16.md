# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday November 16, 2018

This week I was at the Linux Plumbers Conference in Vancouver, so that
will cover the vast majority of the 

## 64-bit `time_t` in the RV32I glibc/Linux ABI

32-bit machines will remain popular for the foreseeable future, as
they're perfectly acceptable for many use cases.  RISC-V won't change
this trend: while clean-room Linux-sized RISC-V designs are likely to be
64-bit it's quite likely that we end up with 32-bit RISC-V designs
running Linux.

One thing we can fix in RISC-V land is `time_t`: this is currently a
32-bit value on all 32-bit platforms, which will overflow in 19 years.
If an embedded, Linux-capable RISC-V design was to be done today it's
likely that it survive until this value overflows.  This will, of
course, break all sorts of assumptions in code.

The 32-bit RISC-V Linux and glibc ABIs are not currently stable because
our glibc port is not yet upstream.  We're targeting the next glibc
release, which itself is targeted for February, for 32-bit RISC-V ABI
stabilization.  That means we have a unique window: over the next month
we need to get all the instances of 32-bit `time_t` out of the RV32I
user ABI.

Cleaning the ABI of all references to 32-bit `time_t` is a lot harder
than it looks.  Arnd Bergmann [gave a
talk](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/2/contributions/57/) at Linux
Plumbers Conference this week.  While it probably won't be possible to
get everything clean, we should at least be able to get the entire
system call interface clean with a bit of help.

After a second round of talks about `time_t` on RV32I, we decided that
it is best to leave RV32I support out of this glibc release.  The freeze
is coming very soon, and there won't be a 64-bit clean `time_t` ABI
ready in time.  Instead we're going to allow everything to slip another
release cycle so we can have a clean RV32I `time_t` ABI.

If you're looking to get into RISC-V kernel development, then now is a
great time to start!

## Platform Specification at RISC-V Microconference

We had three talks related to the platform specification at our
Microconferece: I gave a general overview talk, Atish from WD gave a
talk about creating a base SBI specification, and Paul from SiFive gave
a talk about creating a base power management specification.  We had a
great audience that gave us some very useful feedback, so with any luck
we'll be able to avoid making at least some of the mistakes everyone
else has made.

## Sr.ht, a hosted CI system with RISC-V support

[Sr.ht](https://drewdevault.com/2018/11/15/sr.ht-general-availability.html),
a hosted CI sytsem based on open source software, is now in public beta.
It's offering hardware-backed RISC-V cycles for CI, running on SiFive's
HiFive Unleashed board.

## CKB VM, a software implementation of RISC-V

[CKB VM](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm), a software RISC-V
implementation, has been open source. CKB VM is designed to be used as
a general purpose virtual machine in [Nervos CKB](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb)
blockchain, which brings maximum flexibility and security. While it
is targeted for Nervos CKB for now, CKB VM fully complies with RISC-V
specification, and has the potential to grow into a full featured
RISC-V simulator. An introduction to the design choice behind CKB
VM can be found at [here](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/an-introduction-to-ckb-vm-9d95678a7757).
To the best of our knowledge, CKB VM is the first blockchain
project leveraging RISC-V as the internal virtual machine model.
