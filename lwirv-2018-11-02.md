# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday October 26, 2018

## We've Adopted the CC0-1.0 License

In all honesty, I know very little about the state of open source
licensing -- since I rarely start a new project I rarely have a choice
anyway.  As a result, I've pretty much just relied on the rest of the
RISC-V community to inform me of which license I should use for any
given project, and if the license seem sane I go ahead and adopt it.
Alex Guo has [suggested adopting the CC0-1.0
license](https://github.com/sifive/last-week-in-risc-v/issues/6) for
this repository, which seems sane to me so I've gone ahead and done so.

## RISC-V QEMU Mailing List and Maintainer

The RISC-V QEMU port now has a mailing list, and has picked up Alistair
from Western Digital as an additional maintainer.  See the [pull
request]() for more details.

## Zephyr Blog Post

Nate from SiFive has written an [excellent blog
post](https://www.sifive.com/blog/getting-started-with-zephyr-rtos-v1.13.0-on-risc-v)
detailing the RISC-V Zephyr port, which is in good shape as of the
1.13.0 release.

## LLVM Instructions

Bruce from SiFive has written up some [instructions for building
LLVM](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-llvm#risc-v-llvm), along with how
to build binaries for various RISC-V targets.  His instructions point to
a pre-integration branch containing patches to add support for the full
suite of RISC-V ISA extensions.

## A Small GCC Code Generation Bug

I was writing up an example and discovered an optimization bug in our
GCC port that pretty much explains itself

    $ cat test.c
    struct valerr {
        long value;
        long error;
    };
    
    struct valerr func(void) {
        struct valerr out;
        out.value = 0;
        out.error = 1;
        return out;
    }
    $ riscv64-sifive-elf-gcc test.c -O3 -S -o-
    func:
            addi    sp,sp,-16
            li      a0,0
            li      a1,1
            addi    sp,sp,16
            jr      ra

If anyone is interested in poking around our GCC port, this is probably
a fun way to get started!
