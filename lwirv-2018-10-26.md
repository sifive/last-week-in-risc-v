# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday October 26, 2018

## Embedded Linux Conference, Europe

## We've Adopted the CC0-1.0 License

In all honesty, I know very little about the state of open source
licensing -- since I rarely start a new project I rarely have a choice
anyway.  As a result, I've pretty much just relied on the rest of the
RISC-V community to inform me of which license I should use for any
given project, and if the license seem sane I go ahead and adopt it.
Alex Guo has [suggested adopting the CC0-1.0
license](https://github.com/sifive/last-week-in-risc-v/issues/6) for
this repository, which seems sane to me so I've gone ahead and done so.
