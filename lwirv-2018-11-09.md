# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday November  9, 2018

## OpenWRT Port

Zoltan has [posted a patch
set](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2018-November/014501.html)
to add RISC-V support to OpenWRT, which is based on glibc right now.  It
supports SiFive's VC707 dev kit, HiFive Unleashed, and QEMU.  The port
is experimental, but it's a great way to get started with RISC-V
embedded Linux development.  The patch set is currently in a staging
branch.
