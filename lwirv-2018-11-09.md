# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday November  9, 2018

## OpenWRT Port

Zoltan has [posted a patch
set](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2018-November/014501.html)
to add RISC-V support to OpenWRT, which is based on glibc right now.  It
supports SiFive's VC707 dev kit, HiFive Unleashed, and QEMU.  The port
is experimental, but it's a great way to get started with RISC-V
embedded Linux development.  The patch set is currently in a staging
branch.

## QOM Conversion of RISC-V Devices

Peter Maydell [pointed out that a few of the RISC-V device
models](http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-11/msg01089.html)
in QEMU haven't been properly converted to QEMU's Object Model.
Conversion of these device models will aid us in building configurable
QEMU machines.  If you're interested in getting started with RISC-V QEMU
development, then this is a great place to start!
